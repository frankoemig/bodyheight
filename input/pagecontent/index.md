### Step 1: MindMap

The following mindmap collects and sorts all aspects around body height that are necessary 
for a correct interpretation and clinical use. It has to be recognized that some artifacts 
(eg. reference range) are abbreviated, and the corresponding details must be duplicated. 
Unfortunately, PlantUML mindmaps do not allow for cross-links to denote that.

The following diagram aggregates all aspects that can be found somewhere. 
It tries to arrange them in a way that helps to understand the semantics, and to sort them. 
For the moment, additional explanatory text has not been duplicated from other sources for copyright 
and IP reasons. It can be expected, that this will be done later on.

{% include body_height_mm.svg %}
</div>

### Step 2: Information Model

<div width="500px">
{% include body_height_im.svg %}
</div>

### Step 3: Hierarchy for Vital Signs Profiles (informative)

### Step 4: Technology Binding (ITS)

**How to represent the same information in different standards?**

#### Step 4a: Profile (with FHIR)
